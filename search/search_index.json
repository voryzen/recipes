It could be empty, we are just giving docker a file to point to.

Note: This issue does not occuer in the Powershell terminal, so it might be easier to install Tandoor in powershell and continue development using WSL. Steps to fix this error: Since the permissions have to be changed within the docker container, we will need to create a file that runs as soon as the container starts up. This container will change the permissions of the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory before the db_recipes-1 container is started up. This container sets up the database to accept connections. Docker allows us to set up an entrypoint in the docker-compose.yml file. This is where we will set the commands to change the permissions of the postgres user. Steps to set up entry-point file: 1.  Create a new file \u2018docker-entrypoint.sh\u2019 in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file. This will be a bash file. 2.  Add the following commands to the file a.  #!/bin/sh (This is called a shebang. It tells the OS the shell to use which is the sh shell in this case) b.  chmod 777 /var/lib/postgresql/data (Gives read, write and execute permissions on the directory to all users, you may change these permissions as you wish) c.  exec \u201c@\u201d (Runs the script with the commands above)</p> <p>Your folder structure should look like this with docker-compose.yml and docker-entrypoint.sh in the same directory: </p> <p>The docker-entrypoint.sh file should look like this: </p> <ol> <li>Open the docker-compose.yml file</li> <li>Add an entrypoint configuration to the db_recipes service entrypoint:</li> <li> <p>docker-entrypoint.sh This command makes sure that the docker-entrypoint.sh file is run first before the db_recipes services is started. Using this, we set the database user permission before they are needed, so it gets rid of the error. Your docker-compose.yml file should look like this: </p> </li> <li> <p>Run docker-compose up -d, all the containers should run!</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"system/backup/","title":"Backup","text":"<p>There is currently no \"good\" way of backing up your data implemented in the application itself.

This can be backed up using a function called \"dumpall\". This generates a .SQL file containing a list of commands for a postgresql server to use to rebuild your database. You will also need to back up the media files separately.</p> <p>Making a full copy of the docker directory can work as a back up, but only if you know you will be using the same hardware, os, and postgresql version upon restore. If not, then the different version of postgresql won't be compatible with the existing tables. You can back up from docker even when the tandoor container is failing, so long as the postgresql database has started successfully.

The commands also assume you use a backup name of pgdump.sql. It's a good idea to include a date in this filename, so that successive backups do not get deleted. To back up: <pre><code>sudo docker exec -t docker_db_recipes_1 pg_dumpall -U djangouser &gt; pgdump.sql\n</code></pre></p> <p>To restore: <pre><code>cat pgdump.sql | sudo docker exec -i docker_db_recipes_1 psql postgres -U djangouser\n</code></pre> This connects to the postgres table instead of the actual dgangodb table, as the import function needs to delete the table, which can't be dropped off you're connected to it.</p>"},{"location":"system/backup/#backup-using-export-and-import","title":"Backup using export and import","text":"<p>You can now export recipes from Tandoor using the export function.
